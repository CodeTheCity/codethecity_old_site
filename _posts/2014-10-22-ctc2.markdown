The second code the city saw a large number of new faces, aswell as several returning contributors, gather in Old Aberdeen for the weekend of 18th/19th October 2014 to hack around the topics of [Sports, Health and Wellbeing](/hacks/uk/aberdeen/2014-10-sports-fitness-wellbeing/). We also progressed some projects from the first codethecity, most notably the Matchthecity project which was adopted as a key aspect of several of the weekends projects.
