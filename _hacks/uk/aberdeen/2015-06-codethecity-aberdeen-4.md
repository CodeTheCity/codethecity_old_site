Code The City returns 20th and 21st June 2015

[Aberdeen Tickets now available](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/codethecity-4-environment-tickets-16785390555)

Our next CodeTheCity weekend will be the biggest ever - with workshops happening in Aberdeen and Edinburgh simultaneously.

We'll be working with Edinburgh University, Edinburgh Apps, the City of Edinburgh Council (as well as our usual Aberdeen partners) to bring you two days of civic hacking based on an environmental theme. We'll explore options to collaborate between locations - with some video updates each day.

We'll also post some seed ideas on our wiki - but feel free to suggest your own - and will look to each council to make more data on the environmental theme available.

Finally, there is the possibility of introducing wearables into the weekend, as well a traditional open data-based fun.  Watch this space.

More details will follow soon - including links to registration pages for each location - but for now please hold the dates in your diary: Saturday 20th and Sunday 21st June
