Tickets are now available for Code The City #5 which returns on 24th and 25th October 2015.
 
You can book tickets [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/codethecity-5-culture-tickets-18742322792?aff=es2).

The theme this time is Culture.

We've started a [wiki](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/codethecity-5-culture/wiki) which has project ideas, a call for project suggestions, and a schedule for the weeekend.

In addtion to the usual this time we will be having some fun tech kit for you to try that can be used by non-technical people as well as those with a love for technology. This kit includes:

* [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com) Dev Kit 2 Virtual Reality headset and someone to help you build virtual worlds
* [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com) controller
* Google [Project Tango](https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/) Tablet Dev Kit
* Possibly a MIDI based Electronic Wind Instrument - think synth sax
* Some [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) odds and ends
* A [RaspberryPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org)
