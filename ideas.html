<p>Programmers and designers are just part of the story at <a href="/">codethecity</a>. We also need community members, service providers, and other people involved in helping the various groups that make up our city.</p>

<p>Different groups have different needs, and ensuring those needs are highlighted and represented at the hackathon is important to us. It makes a genuine difference to the projects we create.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways you can get involved:</p>

<h4>Drop in</h4>
<p>A great way to take part if you can't commit to the whole weekend is to come along for an hour and simply talk to the teams. By sharing your experience with our coders and designers you give them a fresh perspective - and might help them better tailor what they build to your users.</p>
<p>Just grab a visitor ticket to ensure you are on the mailing list, and to let us know that you plan to drop by. Then come by anytime </p>

<h4>Lightening talk</h4>
<p>We plan to hold two rounds of lightening talks on the Saturday to allow representatives of local groups / organisations to give a short 3-5 minute presentation about their work. These talks can provoke discussion, inspire our teams, and focus their work. </p>
<p>If you would like to tell our group about your work please email <a href="mailto:steve@refreshaberdeen.com">steve@refreshaberdeen.com</a> and we can discuss timings.</p>

<h4>Project ideas</h4>
<p>We are collecting <a href="https://github.com/CodeTheCity/aberdeen2014/wiki/Project-Ideas">potential projects</a>, and problem areas, to give your teams a running start at codethecity. If you have an area you'd like us to work on please get in touch. Real problems and opportunities are more fun to work on - particularly if you have background information, data (we love data), or examples to share with us.</p>

<h4>Join a team</h4>
<p>Teams don't just need coders, they need <strong>people</strong> too. Joining a team will be a rewarding experience for anyone - you'll be surprised how busy you'll be even without coding skills.</p>
