When attending a CodeTheCity all attendees are expected to adhere to the participant rules and participant agreement to ensure that everyone has a great weekend.

##Participant Rules

###Work with new people
Don't come along expecting to work with a pre-formed team. A large part of what makes CodeTheCity special is the opportunity to work in cross discipline teams with domain specialists and coders and a wealth of other skills. Please don't be offended if the organiser enforces this rule and splits you from your friends.

###Work in mixed groups
Where numbers allow, you will be encouraged to work in teams involving coders/designers and 'domain experts'. It is exactly this mixed group approach that makes CodeTheCity what it is - so please embrace it.

###Use your own tools
Bring your own laptop, camera, pens, yo-yo, and anything else you think you'll need. Where possible the organisers will provide materials to help you out, but try to be self sufficient if you can.

###Share your work
Throughout the event you will be asked to comment on what you are doing, and to show examples. This is a big part of the event, so please cooperate with the event scribes and be as open as possible. If you can share your code in a public repo (yes, before it's 'finished'), all the better.

###Harrassment
CodeTheCity should be a harassment-free experience for everyone. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Failure to adhere to this code of conduct can result in expulsion from the event.

##Participant Agreement

By signing up for CodeTheCity you agree to this participant agreement. 

I agree that I and my heirs, next of kin, guardians, legal representatives and assigns, hereby release, hold harmless, and forever discharge the organisers and venue, its employees, agents, successors, representatives and assigns, from any and all liability, claims, attorneyâ€™s fees, demands, actions, and causes of action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, property damage, or personal injury, including death, that may be sustained by me or to any property belonging to me while participating in the CodeTheCity.
