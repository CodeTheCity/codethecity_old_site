Following the success of the first CodeTheCity event in Aberdeen a few days ago, we are keen to maintain momentum and to rerun CodeTheCity. The unusual combination of people, the open approach, and the tangible results give us confidence that we are on to an interesting formula.

To help this to happen we are working on our manifesto, and a few other key documents at the moment.
