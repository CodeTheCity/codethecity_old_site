# About Codethecity 

Our cities are changing, life in our cities is changing. Access to services is one of the key benefits of locating in a city, but many services are difficult to access. Knowing that they exist, finding where they are, when they are, and who is involved can be a struggle. 

We aim to fix that. 

At code the city youâ€™ll help a passionate group of volunteers to build new tools and services to help people in your community access existing services and even start new ones.

We have a dedicated [team](/team) of volunteers organising events, and a wide pool of talented people from across the city coming along to help us achieve new things for the city.
