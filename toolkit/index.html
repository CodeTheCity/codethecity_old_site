<p>We have been using a new ideation toolkit at  various workshops over the past few months, indeed we kicked off Codethecity Three with an exercise using the deck. It gives us great pleasure to publish the toolkit today.</p>

<p>The full toolkit can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/CodeTheCity/ideation">github</a>. The toolkit is published under a creative commons licence so you are free to download, print, remix and generally change and improve as you see fit.</p>

<p>We've been using the self service print service at moo.com to print the handful of decks we need to run our workshops. There are PDF files in the repo that can be uploaded directly to moo.</p>
