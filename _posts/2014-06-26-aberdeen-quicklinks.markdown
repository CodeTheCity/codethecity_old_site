CodeTheCity Aberdeen took place over the weekend of 21st and 22nd July. We had over 50 participants across the weekend, with eight core teams producing some great projects.

We [blogged all weekend](http://codethecity.tumblr.com) and encouraged teams to share their prototypes and code on github so that people who couldn't make it along could follow along.
Some of the projects to publish their code or release alpha / beta versions so far:

 - [Match The City](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/matchthecity)  ([live demo](https://matchthecity.herokuapp.com/opportunities)) - an event aggregator and search service / platform with several data scrapers / feeds already in place.
 - [FOIAWiki](http://foiawiki.org.uk/) - Linked data project collecting FOI requests, currently pulling data for Aberdeen City Council and East Lothian Council.
 - [Ten Percent News](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/ten_percent_news) - a news service focussing on accessibility and EasyRead producing summaries and flickr api accompanying images.
 - [Volunteer Web App](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/volunteer-app) - streamlining and expanding how people volunteer their time - a dating app for volunteers and volunteering opportunities.
 - [Community Events iOS App](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/volunteer-app) - built to work on both the volunteer app and matchthecity data, a simple event finding app for iPhones / iPads.

Enthusiasm continues, with some teams already posting updates to their projects since the weekend.

We're already looking at dates for the next CodeTheCity Aberdeen, and for a small series of 'micro hack' events on single projects. Huge thanks and appreciation to all the participants.
